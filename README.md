# Password Generator Starter Code

## Motivation
My motivation was to create a password generator which produced secure passwords.

## Website Languages
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Intended Website Functionality
- The user is able to create a secure password from 8 to 128 characters long. 
- The password contains lower and upper case letters, special characters, and numbers.
- Once the user has followed the prompts and met all of the criteria, the website populates the password, writing it on the screen.

## Problems
- The website is not functional. But, happy to say I attempted. #Work-in-Progress!
- Prompts are not working.
- My arrays are a jumbled-mess and need more meaningful names that correlate to what they do.
- I attempted to use, for my arrays, toString and .replace. This was much more of a challenge than anticipated.
- I need to clean up my initial design, note writing, and clean up the syntax.

## Contribution
- I received assistance from the TA and used a lot of MDN and other tutorials/websites. 

## Dreams
- I hope to understand this JS stuff! :-)
